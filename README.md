# adopt-civic-art

This project grew out of the idea of Boston's Adopt-a-Hydrant application, except here we're adapting it to let the public adopt responsibility for checking in on a piece of civic art.  Specifically, civic art that is owned and maintained by the LA County Arts Commission but is too spread out across the County's >4,000 square miles for the commission to efficiently manage.

The basic function of this app is to allow the public to submit photos and a basic damage report for a County-owned piece of civic art.

# history

This project idea was proposed through a monthly gathering of local civic tech/data/government people, [Data + Donuts](http://datadonuts.la).  The idea was then pitched at Hack For LA's 2/7/17 hack night and quickly attracted a group of interested individuals.

Since then, members have created a user survey and conducted user interviews.  We'll define a set of required features from the results and then we'll create a couple different app mockups for comparison.

# specs

We chose to start with a web app.  Using a tool like PhoneGap, we'll have the possibility of compiling to mobile later on.  We will need some sort of data storage/database solution.

# needs

We'll take anyone interested in joining, but we could really use additional members with skills in project management, graphic design, front end development, and backend development.
